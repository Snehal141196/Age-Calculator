Sometimes its difficult to count the age manually so by this simple and small project which anyone can run just clicking on run button.

(This is for the one who is not from IT background)
For this project you just need to install Anaconda Software.
After that launch jupyter notebook.
If you want to run the cell one by one just click on ctrl+enter.
If you want to run from starting then click on restart and run all.
